Subsequently, geographic identifiers were cleanly extracted from `county_name` into `state` and `county` columns, and the redundant `county_name` was dropped (cell `1e8b4e74`). This ensured a consistent and accurate base dataset for analysis.\n","\n","2.  **Refined Temporal Feature Engineering and Analysis**:\n","    *   Cell `03167449` was modified to introduce a `month_name` column and to convert both `month_name` and `day_name` into ordered categorical types. This corrected an issue where temporal groupings were not correctly ordered or indexed in subsequent analyses.\n","    *   Cell `787f6c58` (Temporal Pattern Analysis) was updated to leverage these new ordered categorical columns for monthly and day-of-week patterns, ensuring correct sorting. Additionally, the hourly outage pattern calculation was revised to report the *proportion of total outages* occurring at each hour, providing a more meaningful insight into the distribution of outage events over the day, rather than an incorrect outage rate.\n","\n","3.  **Re-execution of EDA Sections**: The following exploratory data analysis sections were re-executed to reflect these fundamental data and feature engineering corrections:\n","    *   `47ab4fc5` (Geographic Risk Assessment)\n","    *   `66c8b434` (Weather-Outage Correlation Analysis)\n","    *   `bbb80f6b` (Descriptive Statistics)\n","\n","These steps have led to more accurate and statistically sound results for the exploratory data analysis, addressing the initial issues of data consistency and analysis logic."],"id":"5a8d1856"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"f35594c4"},"source":["## Final Task\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Summarize the corrections made and present the updated statistical analyses.\n"],"id":"f35594c4"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"81b8b397"},"source":["## Summary:\n","\n","### Data Analysis Key Findings\n","\n","The previous analysis issues have been corrected through data re-integration, geographic cleaning, refined temporal feature engineering, and re-execution of exploratory data analysis sections.\n","\n","*   **Data Integration and Cleaning**: The dataset (`merged_df`) was successfully re-integrated, comprising 3,976,135 observations across 43 states and 1,066 counties. Missing outage indicators were filled, and geographic identifiers (`state`, `county`) were standardized, resulting in an overall outage rate of 46.3% between 2014 and 2020.\n","*   **Temporal Patterns**:\n","    *   **Yearly Trends**: The outage rate significantly increased from 6.1% in 2014 to 75.4% in 2020.\n","    *   **Monthly Patterns**: May exhibited the highest outage rate at 50.5%.\n","    *   **Day of Week Patterns**: Weekdays showed higher outage rates (around 47-48%) compared to weekends (around 42-43%).\n","    *   **Hourly Patterns**: 0:00 (midnight) was identified as the peak hour for outages, accounting for 38.7% of all outages, while 23:00 had the lowest proportion at 1.1%.\n","*   **Geographic Risk Assessment**:\n","    *   **State-level**: Illinois (79.7%), Idaho (78.3%), and Oklahoma (76.9%) recorded the highest outage rates, while New York (14.4%) and North Carolina (15.9%) had the lowest among states with sufficient observations.\n","    *   **Regional-level**: The West (54.9%) and Midwest (52.6%) regions experienced higher average outage rates than the Northeast (43.2%) and Southeast (36.9%).\n","*   **Weather-Outage Correlation**: Direct correlations between individual weather variables (`tmax`, `tmin`, `prcp`) and outage occurrence were very low (ranging from -0.0165 to -0.0025). Extreme weather conditions, including combinations like \"Cold + high precip,\" resulted in outage rates close to or slightly above the baseline average (e.g., 46.9% for \"Cold + high precip\" versus a 46.3% baseline).\n","*   **Descriptive Statistics**:\n","    *   **Temperature**: The mean daily temperature range was 12.0°C.
